# data-structure-and-algorithm by Suny
It is a beginner friendly text file to understand different data structure and algorithm stuffs.
If we want to go from city to city There can be many ways of doing this: by flight, by bus, by train
and also by cycle. Depending on the availability and convenience we choose the one which suits us.
Similarly, in computer science there can be multiple algorithms exist for solving the same problem (for example, sorting problem has lot of algorithms like insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and many more).
Algorithm analysis helps us determining which of them is efficient in terms of time and space consumed.

# GOAL OF ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS BY SUNY?
The goal of is to compare algorithms (or solutions) mainly in terms of running
time but also in terms of other factors (e.g., memory, developer's effort etc.)
It is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem (input size)
increases. Input size is number of elements in the input and depending on the problem type the input may
be of different types. In general, we encounter the following types of inputs.
 Size of an array
 Polynomial degree
 Number of elements in a matrix
 Number of bits in binary representation of the input
 Vertices and edges in a graph

# HOW TO COMPARE ALGOs:
To compare algorithms, let us define some .
Execution times? as execution times are specific to a particular computer.
Number of statements executed? since the number of statements varies with the
programming language as well as the style of the individual programmer.
Ideal Solution?
Let us assume that we expressed running time of given algorithm as a function of the input size (i.e.,
). We can compare these different functions corresponding to running times and this kind of
comparison is independent of machine time, programming style, etc..
